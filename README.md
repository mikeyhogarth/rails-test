This Rails application is a foundation for the following Ruby on Rails technical test. To start the test please fork this repository and follow the instructions below.

## Tasks

* Create an API endpoint that receives the following format `params` hash and creates the resources:

```ruby
{
  sales: [
    {
      date: '20140103',
      time: '0700',
      code: 'FL',
      value: '2.00'
    },
    {
      date: '20140103',
      time: '0815',
      code: 'DO',
      value: '1.00'
    }
  ]
}
```

* Create a JSON API endpoint for reading a specific sale.
* Create a JSON API endpoint for destroying a specific sale.
* Implement password security for sales during their creation that must then be used to retrieve that sale.

### Notes

* The creation API endpoint should be able to receive both a singular resource hash and an array of multiple resource hashes.
* Data should be stored in in it's appropriate format but presented in the fashion demonstrated above.
* Please implement password security manually - do not use `has_secure_password`.

## Caveats & Rules

### Time Constraint

You should not spend more than **4 hours** on this test. We measure time spent developing as the time between your first and last commit. If you complete the test before reaching the time limit do not feel obliged to continue up to the 4 hour marker.

### Testing

We use [RSpec](https://relishapp.com/rspec) and follow an outside-in testing approach. Approach testing your work in the same way you would during your day-to-day development as we use tests as a marker for code quality.

### Quality Indicators

Please make use of quality indicators such as [CodeClimate](http://codeclimate.com), [Travis CI](travis-ci.com) and [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io). Update the provided badges in your `README.md` when setting up.

### Commit History

Please keep your commit history clear and descriptive, following best practices for Git commits. Your commit history allows us to observe your thought process and how you approach a problem.
